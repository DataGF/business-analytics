# Predicting Transportation Mode

## Step 1 - Verifying Data

Here we will utilize know transportation data of a firm's employees. The data was arranged in a alteryx format file: employees-transportationdata.yxdb. The missing data was arranged in a csv format file: missingemployee.csv.

Fist of all we need to know how is our data so we used Alteryx Field Sumary Tool to do that. We verifyed the following data.

1. [Employees Age](https://github.com/DataGF/business-analytics/blob/main/predicting-transportation-mode/1_checkingDataAge.pdf).
2. [Employees Distance from Job (in miles)](https://github.com/DataGF/business-analytics/blob/main/predicting-transportation-mode/1_checkingDataDriveDistanceMiles.pdf).
3. [Employees ID](https://github.com/DataGF/business-analytics/blob/main/predicting-transportation-mode/1_checkingDataEmployeeID.pdf).
4. [Employees Gender](https://github.com/DataGF/business-analytics/blob/main/predicting-transportation-mode/1_checkingDataGender.pdf).
5. [Employees Known Transportation Data](https://github.com/DataGF/business-analytics/blob/main/predicting-transportation-mode/1_checkingDataKnowTransportationMode.pdf).
6. [Employees Marital Status](https://github.com/DataGF/business-analytics/blob/main/predicting-transportation-mode/1_checkingDataMaritalStatus.pdf).
